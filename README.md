# autopilot offline

inspired by my many crashes in elite dangerous i've build an 8bit version of the docking minigame, you have to dock by hand because the autopilot is "offline" (this years theme for js13k)

Todo [12/09/18]

- [x] Add fuel counter, via code and visual display
- [x] ship should just float if you run out of fuel, start timer for about 2 seconds to end game
- [x] make station a hexagon and not bright red
- [x] collision detection :(
- [x] initial load screen
- [x] randomise start location and position of the station

final design passover

- [x] sound?
- [x] background design
- [x] improve ship and space station assets
- [x] ui update
- [x] restart game on gameover
